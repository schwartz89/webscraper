# Caveat. Lists are iterables, and the in method acts on iterables, not just strings

## making .exe
After writing a Python script or program you can use PyInstaller
pip install pyinstaller
And then do the following to create an exe file that should run without the need of having Python installed on the target PC
pyinstaller --onefile program.py
the ‘—onefile’ parameter is used to put all the needed files and libraries into a single executable file. It is important that you look at creating a virtual environment to manage your project packages.

#extend vs append. Append adds it as a sublist extend tacks it onto the list

#search by surname and first name by splitting
The simplest way will just be to check for forename and surname. In your example, you could do:
search_terms = "Barack Obama"
matches = []
for memo_string in memos_list:
    for word in search_terms.split(" "): #this is the splitter
        if word not in memo_string:
            break
    else:
        matches.append(memo_string) # triggers when the for loop doesn't break
