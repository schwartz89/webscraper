## making .exe
After writing a Python script or program you can use PyInstaller
pip install pyinstaller
And then do the following to create an exe file that should run without the need of having Python installed on the target PC
pyinstaller --onefile program.py
the ‘—onefile’ parameter is used to put all the needed files and libraries into a single executable file. It is important that you look at creating a virtual environment to manage your project packages.
